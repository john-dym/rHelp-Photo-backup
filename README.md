How to be able to use a variable in a file name
I am trying to make a code that can automatically backup my photos to dated folders. I would like to just make it and almost never have to edit it, so I want to use a variable with the date in my file name, so my files are moved to this new folder. I really have no idea how to do it, or if there is a work around. I am sorry if this kind of question has been previously asked. Here is my code; I want to be able to have the date (06.07.2019) to be a variable that changes itself automatically, rather than me having to change it every time I want to use the programme, which is almost every day. Thanks, Ollie (Bot Melvin)

My reply
I didn't understand what your question was but using your code I came up with this. It created a new directory in main "06.07.2019" then moves files from dirs "H:\DCIM" and changes the name for example Pictures 001.jpg becomes Pictures 001 06.07.2019.jpg. Now that i think about it if you put the pictures in a dated name folder i guess u dont have to change the file name. Oh well this was a learning experience for me. For my testing i was using blank text files.
